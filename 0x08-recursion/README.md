# Recursion
## Concepts
### Recursive Solutions
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self similar way, that is it
it reduces a problem to simpler versions of the same problem.
Semantically, recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself.
- There must be one or more **base cases** that evaluate trivially.
- It mus solve the **same problem** on some other input with the goal of **simplifying** the **larger problem input**.
